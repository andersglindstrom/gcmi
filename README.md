# gcmi : Gaussian-Copula Mutual Information

This is a workbook that reproduces, in Python, some of the simulations presented in the following paper:

RAA Ince, BL Giordano, C Kayser, GA Rousselet, J Gross and PG Schyns  
"A statistical framework for neuroimaging data analysis based on mutual information estimated via a Gaussian copula"  
*Human Brain Mapping* (2017) 38 p. 1541-1573 [doi:10.1002/hbm.23471](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hbm.23471)

The workbook uses the python module written by Robert Ince to support that article. The original code can be found here:

I have copied the python module gcmi.py to this repository for use in the workbook.
